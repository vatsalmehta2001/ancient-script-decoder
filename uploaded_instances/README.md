# Uploaded Instances Directory

This directory contains temporary image files uploaded by users through the app interface. These files are not tracked in Git but the directory structure is maintained.

The directory will be populated with images when:
1. Users upload hieroglyph images through the web interface
2. The application detects and crops hieroglyphs from uploaded images

These files are temporary and not tracked by Git.
