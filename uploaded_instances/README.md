# Uploaded Instances Directory

This directory stores temporary files created during the analysis process, such as:

- Individual hieroglyph images extracted from uploaded images
- Annotated images with bounding boxes and labels
- Other temporary files needed for the application

This directory is created automatically by the setup script and is excluded from version control (except for this README file).
