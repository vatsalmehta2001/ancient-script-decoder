# Test Images Directory

This directory contains sample hieroglyph images for testing the application. These images are included in the repository and can be used as examples when running the application.

These sample images are useful for:
- Testing the application without uploading your own images
- Demonstrating the capabilities of the hieroglyph recognition system
- Providing examples of the expected input format

The "Use a test image instead" button in the application interface will use images from this directory.
