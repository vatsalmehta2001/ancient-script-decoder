# Advanced Model Output Directory

This directory contains model files and outputs from the advanced training process:

- `app_ready_model.h5`: The trained and optimized model file used by the application
- Other model checkpoints and artifacts (generated during training)

The model files are stored using Git LFS (Large File Storage) due to their size.
