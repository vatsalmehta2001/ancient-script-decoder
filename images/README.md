# Images for Documentation

This directory should contain the following images for the project documentation:

## Required Screenshots

1. **demo_screenshot.png** - Screenshot of the application's main interface showing hieroglyph recognition in action

2. **model_architecture.png** - Diagram of the model architecture showing the CNN, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer components

3. **example_recognition.png** - Example of successful hieroglyph recognition showing prediction confidence scores

4. **sample_hieroglyphs.png** - Grid of sample hieroglyphs from the training dataset with their Gardiner codes

5. **augmentation_examples.png** - Examples of data augmentation applied to hieroglyph images

6. **class_distribution.png** - Bar chart showing the distribution of hieroglyph classes in the dataset

## How to Create These Images

1. For application screenshots, run the application with `streamlit run app.py` and take screenshots

2. For model architecture diagrams, you can use visualization tools or create a diagram in any drawing software

3. For data visualizations, you can use the scripts in the repository or create visualizations using matplotlib

4. Place all images in this directory with the exact names listed above

Once these images are added, the GitHub repository will display them properly in the README.md file.
