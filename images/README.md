# Images for Documentation

This directory contains the following images for the project documentation:

## Existing Images (Already Copied)

I've copied several visualization images from the project:

1. **sample_hieroglyphs.png** - Grid of sample hieroglyphs from the training dataset with their Gardiner codes
2. **augmentation_examples.png** - Examples of data augmentation applied to hieroglyph images
3. **class_distribution.png** - Bar chart showing the distribution of hieroglyph classes in the dataset
4. **example_recognition.png** - Example of successful hieroglyph recognition 
5. **model_architecture.png** - Training history graph showing accuracy and loss

## Still Needed

1. **demo_screenshot.png** - Screenshot of the application's main interface showing hieroglyph recognition in action

## How to Create Remaining Images

1. For application screenshots, run the application with `streamlit run app.py` and take screenshots of the interface
2. Place all images in this directory with the specified filenames
3. If you want to replace any existing images with better versions, simply overwrite them

Once these images are added, the GitHub repository will display them properly in the README.md file.
